# To Do List üìù

To Do List is an app to list tasks.


# Technical description ‚öôÔ∏è

To Do List project consists of a landingpage developed in React, which contains a form that allows us to add tasks to a to-do list. Users can delete each task individually. It has been taken into account that, once a task is entered, it is not deleted if the page is reloaded or closed. When a task is created, deleting all items option (with a single click) is shown, this option disappears if there are no items in the list. Finally, to prevent blank tasks from being added, an alert has been set and this possibility has been "removed".

This application is a responsive and simple design project with aesthetic and chromatic coherence in all its elements. Using the aos library, I have incorporated slight animations.
